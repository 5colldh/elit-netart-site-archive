            <p>Olia Lialina’s moving hypertext elegy is a seminal work of the early Net Art scene. With artists like Alexei Shulgin and JODI, Lialina helped establish key characteristics that would come to characterize Internet art in the 1990’s. <code>My Boyfriend Came Back from the War</code> has emerged as one of the most resilient of the early Net Art pieces, in no small part due to its emotional and narrative power as well as the large number of remixes (game mods, ports, and even T-shirts) by other artists that Lialina has collected on her site.</p>
