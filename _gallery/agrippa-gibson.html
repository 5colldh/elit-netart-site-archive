            <p>William Gibson, author of cyberpunk classic <em>Neuromancer</em> (1984), built his scrolling electronic poem <code>Agrippa</code> to delete itself after one viewing. Naturally, hackers took this as a challenge, and the ephemeral text was quickly uploaded to the nascent Internet. However, while it is easy to find a copy of <code>Agrippa</code>’s text, only emulating the original software platform allows the reader to experience the fleeting volatility of this strange rumination on memory and impermanence.</p>

            <h5>Note from the gallery, rendered quaintly unnecessary by its new website home: </h5>
            <p><code>Agrippa</code> runs in an emulating program called Mini vMac. This program attempts to emulate a range of early Macintosh operating systems, with varying levels of success.</p>
            <p>Due to some hardware differences (notably, the much faster clock cycles of this computer’s CPU), the <code>Agrippa</code> in today’s exhibit runs very fast and is difficult to read.</p>
            <p>We have chosen instead to run a video of a computer emulating the program at the proper speed. We hope you appreciate this irony, and if you wish to see the program in (too-fast) emulation, please ask the gallery attendant.</p>
