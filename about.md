# About `E.LIT / NET.ART`

`E.LIT / NET.ART` is a loose confederation of pop-up `galleries`, `courses`, `screening` programs, and websites that explore the contours, vocabularies, and histories of electronic literature, Internet art, and digital cinema. The project’s goals are to explore what the aesthetics and histories of digitality across the written word and moving image, and to collect representative works of the genres under one roof. The individual pieces that together constitute `E.LIT / NET.ART` are unabashedly aimed at audiences unaquainted with the fields of electronic literature or the digital humanities: they are introductions, and sites of future exploration and conversation.

`E.LIT / NET.ART` began as a series of [grant-funded](http://5colldh.org/elit-netart) one-off `galleries` in various spaces across the Five Colleges of Western Massachusetts from 2013 to 2014. Each `gallery` hosted a core group of twelve electronic literature pieces across multiple genres, including hypertext fiction, interactive text adventures, and digital animations. The core group was curated less as a canon of electronic literature (could such a thing be said to exist), and more as a demonstration of a range of aesthetic, technical, and imaginative possibilities for the form. Some `galleries` hosted additional pieces, including a `gallery` of historical video games and the `screening` event [“Procedure, Structure, Algorithm: A Survey of Cinema’s Digital Turn”](/screening).

In January 2015, `E.LIT / NET.ART`’s curator, [Jeffrey Moro](https://jeffreymoro.com) ran a week-long `course` at Smith College called [E.LIT / NET.ART: An Extraordinary Brief Survey of Digital Literature, 1975 – 2015](/course). As the tounge-in-cheek title suggests, the `course` aimed to introduce participants to a range of digital literatures, organized, as with the `galleries`, by expressive strategies rather than by chronology. The course was a part of [Five College Digital Humanities’](http://5colldh.org) larger effort to offer short experiences designed to develop participants’ abilities to critique and historicize digital media. 

# Navigating this site

This website is an interactive record of the various individual projects that constitute `E.LIT / NET.ART`. The curatorial captions from both the `gallery` and `screening` programs are reproduced in full, and the syllabus and assignments from the `course` are publicly available. In order to respect artists’ legal rights, this site does not actively host any of the individual pieces represented in the `gallery` or `screening` programs: where possible, links are provided to pieces’ long-term archival homes at [the Electronic Literature Collection](http://collection.eliterature.org), [Rhizhome’s ArtBase](http://rhizome.org/artbase/), or individual artists’ websites. 

The primary way to navigate this site is through the text-based Terminal at the top of each page. In order to allay any opacity in navigation, visitors should know that any word they find in `code` style is a potentially useful search term. There are, however, many others hidden away.
